      <p>I'm a full-stack software engineer and will be graduating from the Galvanize Full Stack program in October 2015.  I love building businesses and expanding projects, and am excited to jump in to a team with a strong pair-oriented development intitiative.  I want to learn from experienced veterans, and take that education to the next level!</p>

        <h4>Music Player</h4>
        <p>This simple music player is Javascript based and interacts with four audio files.  The player functions as a typical player would, with each song playing individually and their Title and Artist names displaying in the header as they play.  This was our first interaction involving icons from Font Awesome as well.</p>

        <h4>Simple Markdown Editor</h4>
        <p>The Markdown Editor was our first interaction with third-party Javascript libraries, utilizing a js.on package and Showdown (which parses HTML into Markdown format).  This project's purpose was actually intended to build coding speed, racing to execute rudimentary commands as quickly and accurately as possible (I was able to generate this page in 4 minutes and 38 seconds!)</p>
